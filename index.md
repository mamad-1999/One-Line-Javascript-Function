# JavaScript Functions

In this repository, I have compiled a list of one-line JavaScript Functions that are used daily and needed by every developer.

## Let’s Start
---
### 1. Get a random boolean

```bash
  const RandomBoolean = () => Math.random() >= 0.5;
```

#### This function will return a boolean (true or false) using Math.random() method. It’s a 50/50 chance to get either true or false.
